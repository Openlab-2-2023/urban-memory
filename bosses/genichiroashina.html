        <h2>Genichiro Ashina</h2>

        <p>Genichiro Ashina (葦名弦一郎, Ashina Genichirou) is very first boss youll meet. In first encounter you cannot defeat him.<br>
            The man who stole the Wolf's Lord at the beginning of the game, Genichiro Ashina is holding him at the top of a building in Ashina Castle.
            He wields a large bow along with his two handed katana.
        </p>
        <p>Second time youl meet him in Ashina Tower.
After defeating him he will tranform in: <strong>Genichiro Way of Tomoe</strong></p>
<p>
    FIRST PHASE ATTACKS: </p>
   <p><strong>Leaping Slam into Thrust Attack</strong> - After being attacked, Genichiro will launch himself into the air and execute a sword slam.<br>
Can be sidestepped for a few hits. If parried, Genichiro will follow up with a Thrust attack that can be Mikiri Countered.<br><br>
    <strong>Floating Passage</strong> - Genichiro executes the Floating Passage Art. After Genichiro perfectly parries Sekiro, he will begin a long string of sword attacks concluding with the Floating Passage.<br>
It is advised to only attempt to block or deflect his attacks while at high posture.</p>
<p>SECOND PHASE ATTACKS:</p>
 <p><strong>Sword Dive Thrust Attack</strong> - If idle, Genichiro will attempt to interrupt healing by charging Sekiro with a sword dive. This can be Mikiri Countered or deflected.<br><br>
    <strong>Electric slash</strong> - After the warning, jump in the air. If you are hit by the attack, press attack before you land to deflect electricity back. Does heavy health damage and stuns Genichiro.<br><br>
     <strong>Electric slam</strong> - Same as Electric slash.</p>
     <p> <strong>Pro tip</strong>: Repeatedly spam Shadowrush. This move will slowly chip away at his HP bar without him counterattacking, allowing you to finish him off or more easily fill up his Posture gauge.</p>
