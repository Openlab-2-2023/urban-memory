        <p>Great Shinobi Owl (大忍び 梟, Great Shinobi Owl, Daishinobi Fukurō)<br>
            You met your father Owl. Shinobi who saved little kid on battlefield. You can help him and be disloyal to Kuro. Or stay loyal but fight your own Father.
        </p>
    <p>FIRST PHASE ATTACKS: </p>
   <p><strong>NOTE: This boss is capable of using a powerful Mikiri Counter which deals massive (often fatal) damage.<br>
     As such, it is advised not to use thrust attacks unless Owl is open to counterattacks. <br>
     Unlike his Hirata counter part however, Shadow Rush will not trigger his mikiri counter.</strong><br><br>
    <strong>Shinobi Charm</strong> - Owl tosses a charm into the air that releases a green mist upon touching the ground. 
    This attack does not damage the player however if the player is touched by the mist they will be unable to use healing items (Healing Gourd, Pellets, etc.) for 30 seconds.
     This is often used to end combos performed by the Owl<br><br>
    <strong>Backflip</strong> - He leaps off of you and throws shuriken in your direction. Parry the first blow and the shuriken.<br><br>
    <strong>Running Slash</strong> - Owl runs towards you and performs a single strong slash.<br><br>
    <strong>4-slash Combo</strong> - Owl performs 4 consecutive slashes with his sword. This attack is often followed by a Shinobi Charm.<br><br>
    <strong>Shuriken Throw & Flip</strong> - Owl will throw 2 shuriken then flip towards you in the air and then perform a single downward strike with his sword.<br><br>
    <strong>Shuriken Slash</strong> - Owl throws a shuriken at the player immediately followed by a running slash. Similar to the Chasing Slice Shinobi Martial Art.<br><br>
    <strong>Firecracker</strong> - Sometimes he will throw black gunpowder that explodes like the Shinobi Firecracker and does damage.<br><br>
    <strong>Stomp (grab)</strong> - Owl will raise his foot into the air then stomp down pinning the player to the ground and stabbing them through the chest. This attack does massive damage and cannot be blocked and does not have a Perilous indicator.<br><br>
</p>
<p>SECOND PHASE ATTACKS:</p>
 <p><strong>Backflip</strong> - Same as in phase one but he does throw poison. Keep away from the area and keep some antidote by hand.<br><br></p>
