        <p>Divine Dragon（桜竜, Sakura Dragon）<br>
        A Divine Realm. Place where a Divine Dragon lives. His tears can cure sickness or end Immortal Serverance.
        </p>
<p>
    FIRST PHASE ATTACKS: </p>
   <p>In first phase youll will not fight divine dragon directly, but the Old Dragons of the Tree (白木の翁たち, White-wooden Old Men) which is a very simple fight. As the enemies move very slowly and <strong> do not charge directly at the player</strong>.
   </p>
   <p>SECOND PHASE ATTACKS:</p>
   <p>In the second phase the player finally faces the Divine Dragon. Attemping to approach it in close range will cause the Divine Dragon to summon a mighty gust that will push the player far away.<br>
    In order to damage the Divine Dragon, the player needs to run towards the trees that are charged with electricity and hit Divine Dragon with spear of lightning.<br>
    After defeating Divine Dragon youll get a <strong>GRACIOUS GIFT OF TEARS</strong>.
   </p>
 <p>I very recommend to fight this Boss all alone for best experience.</p>
