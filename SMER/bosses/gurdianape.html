            FIRST PHASE ATTACKS:
            Close range attacks: rapid slamming, 2 grabs- All slamming attacks can be blocked, try to deflect all of them.
            Status attacks: poisonous farting, poisonous poo -When his back is turned, if you attack him there's a chance he's gonna fart, 
            inflicting heavy poison build up. Quickly dodge away from cloud to avoid poison. This attack is always followed by
            him running away, jumping high in the air, and throwing you his poo.
</pre>
        <pre>SECOND PHASE ATTACKS:
            Overhead Slam: Jumping sweep-After deflecting hits from certain combos, or mid-air kicking him after his jumping slash he will go for a delayed overhead slam.
                                      Successfully deflecting this attack will stun him and leave his neck exposed.
            Scream: Upon putting his head back on his neck he lets out a scream, dealing damage and building up terror if you're too close.
