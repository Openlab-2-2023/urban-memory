        <p>Corrupted Monk (real name Yao) (破戒僧, Depraved Monk)<br>
            The Corrupted Monk can be fought twice throughout the game: once with just one health bar and then again with three depending on the chosen ending. 
        </p>
<p>
   Fight: </p>
   <p>The player must fight the single health bar illusion version in Mibu Village of the Ashina Depths to collect the <strong>Shelter Stone</strong> in order to proceed through the story.<br>
    She is not an Apparition type enemy, so Divine Confetti will not deal extra damage to her however she is an illusion so, Snap Seed, Fistful of Ash and/or Lazulite Axe can be used to briefly stun her; with that in mind, it is possible to perform stunlocks and prevent any counter attack</p>
