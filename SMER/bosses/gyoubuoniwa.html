        <pre>You have two options how to defeat this boss. First is fight him face to face. Second is method called "Gyoubu skip".
        Gyobu skip is not intended way how to kill him but is interesting way to challange up the game.                                
        </pre>
        <pre>PHASES ATTACKS:

            First and Second Phase:
        Standart Combo-(Overhead,Downward,Long Overhead): First easy to deflect, second fast but can still be perfectly blocked, third is over his head and by deflect will cause Gyobu stagger.
        Detaching Thrust: Throw a spear with rope. Can be deflected.
        Jumping Attacks: 3 jumps with spear pointed at you. Can be dodged or deflected.
        Detaching Sweeo: When player is far Gyobu starts swing with tip of his spear on rope hitting large circle around him.
