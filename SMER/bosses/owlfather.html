        So you went for Purification Ending. After you get Father's Bell Charm and went in another memory in Hirata Estate.<br> Were was a Lady Butterfly now stands your Father. Stronger, smarter and know use fire element.</p>
<p>
    FIRST PHASE ATTACKS: </p>
   <p><strong>Zig-Zag</strong> - Many of Owl's attacks initiate after a zig-zag motion designed to confuse you. After this, he can do any of the following 5 moves:<br><br>
    <strong>Shuriken Throw</strong> - Owl throws a single shuriken<br><br>
    <strong>Double Shuriken + flip</strong> - Owl will throw 2 shuriken then flip towards you in the air and then perform a single downward strike with his sword. <br><br>
    <strong>Shadowfall</strong> - Just like your Mushin Shadowfall Combat Art. Owl will charge up for an unblockable thrust, and if it hits, he will jump off and come down with 2 huge slashes. <br><br>
    <strong>Shuriken Slash</strong> - Owl throws a shuriken at the player immediately followed by a running slash. Similar to the Chasing Slice Shinobi Martial Art<br><br>
    <strong>Perilous Sweep</strong> - Owl will move from the side and perform an unblockable sweep. Jump over it. He can perform the following after this:<br><br>
    <strong>Large Overhead Slash</strong> - Owl will load up for a very powerful overhead slash. If you dodge to the side he will switch to a turning slash. If you dodge backwards he will perform a flip towards you and slash. <br><br>
    <strong>Backflip</strong> - Owl leaps off of you. It deals no vitality damage but much posture damage.<br><br>
    <strong>Firecrackers</strong> - Owl throws blinding firecrackers in your face, then makes them explode. He can follow up with either Shuriken Throw, Shadowfall or Shuriken Slash <br><br>
    <strong>Running Slash</strong> - Owl runs towards you and performs a single strong slash. He can perform the following 2 moves after this:<br><br>
    <strong>5-slash Firecracker Combo</strong> -Owl performs 3 consecutive slashes with his sword, followed by an elbow, followed by firecrackers, which he will slash through.<br><br>
    <strong>Stomp (deathblow)</strong> - Owl will raise his foot into the air then stomp down pinning the player to the ground and stabbing them through the chest. This attack does massive damage and cannot be blocked and does not have a Perilous indicator. 
    Owl will likely use this after breaking the player's posture if he is close enough. <br><br></p>
    <p>SECOND PHASE:<br>
    <strong>Owl Teleport</strong> - Owl will use his summoned owl to teleport above you and drop down with a slash<br><br>
    <strong>Fire Owl + Shadowfall</strong> - Owl will summon his owl to his hand and throw an unblockable fire owl projectile towards you, then follow up with Shadowfall. <br><br>
